First, put the main character onto a scene.

Then, drag the conversation script to them.

Create a UI Text, and add this to the conversation script "Dialoguebox" slot

Create another character, and give it the tag "NPC"

Drag the Dialogue script to them, and put a name into their script

Create a text file in the Project B5 folder with the name you gave the character. Also add text to it.

Drag the "Player Controller v2" script to the main character instead of the original -- this new one allows you to press "I" to interact with players/objects, along with preventing you from moving when you start an interaction. 

Create a circle/sphere flattened into a circle

Drag this circle to the NPC character to make it clear they can be interacted with

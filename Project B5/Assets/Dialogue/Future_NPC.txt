Hello, officer.

The translocation gateway to the west will bring you to the Future Zone.

Our zone is rife with security cameras and robots.
The robots patrol slowly but they can move around.
The cameras are stuck in one place but scan left and right quickly.
If they catch you, they'll beam you back to the start.

Scans report a time fragment in the middle of the complex.

High tachyon readings mean a fragment is behind the beam cage too.

Watch out for lasers.
Pew pew!

Hail, wizard!
Art thou here to ameliorate our woes?

Enter the Past Zone through yonder eastern portal.
The Past Zone hath numerous patrolling guards.
If thou hast keen eye and sharp wit, thou canst outsmart the oafs.

One of the time fragments is squirreled away in the hedge maze.
Another lies beyond the bridge under a guard's watchful gaze.
If thou art caught by the guards, thou shalt be spirited away!

Wouldst those yonder future folk mind if I used their plumbing?

Time is a fragile thing.
Like most fragile things, time requires a caretaker.
This guardian of time kept things together.
This guardian kept things whole.
But there are forces who dislike order.
There are forces who desire entropy.
These forces of chaos destroyed the guardian.

And so the world around us unraveled.
Now, what once was whole is segmented.
We barely cling to the present
as our past and future lay in fragments.

You must collect these fragments
to make things whole again.

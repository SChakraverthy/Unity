Thank goodness you're here, Time Cop!
You have to collect 5 time fragments from each zone.
Then things will return to normal!
..hopefully.

If you want to know about the Past Zone, talk to the people to the east.
If you want to know about the Future Zone, talk to the people to the west.

Or you can keep talking to me.

It gets lonely out here in space.
